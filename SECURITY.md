## Security Architecture

Capra-Falconeri is engineered with a zero-trust, identity-first model. Core security layers include:

- **Passwordless Authentication:** FIDO2/WebAuthn biometric access ‚Äî no passwords stored or transmitted  
- **End-to-End Encryption:** TLS 1.3 with forward secrecy and mTLS for mutual trust  
- **Blockchain-Backed Audit Trails:** Immutable logs for every critical action  
- **SBOM & CI/CD Integrity:** Syft-generated SBOMs, CodeQL scans, and SHA-256 PDF stamping in CI  
- **Runtime Hardening:** Flask + NGINX reverse proxy with strict CSP, HSTS, and rate limiting  
- **DNS & Email Security:** DNSSEC, DMARC (reject), SPF, and DKIM enforced  
- **Quantum-Resistant Modules:** Fortress-Verified‚Ñ¢ AI modules with post-quantum cryptographic readiness
